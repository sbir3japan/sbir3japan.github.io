This is a version of Corda Guide by SBI R3 Japan based on Hugo. It is not the official Corda Guide, which can be found [here](https://support.sbir3japan.co.jp/hc/ja).

## Theme

The theme in use is [Docsy](https://example.docsy.dev/).
You can find detailed theme instructions in the Docsy user guide: https://docsy.dev/docs/.

The theme is included in this project as a Git submodule:

```bash
â–¶ git submodule
