# How to contribute to Corda Guide

There are two ways to submit a new article to Corda Guide:
1. fork the repository and make a pull request
2. open a new issue with the article in attachment (as .md file) 

We encourage the method #1 since it allows a standard github review of the article and the procedure more smooth.

## Fork and make a pull request

1. Fork the repository to your personal github account
2. Pull the repository locally to your laptop
3. Create the article file. 
   1. All the articles are under `/content/jp/docs/[developers|faq|release_notes|understanding_corda]`
   2. Create a new .md file for your article. You can copy/paste a file
